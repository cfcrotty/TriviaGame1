TriviaGame1 Homework by CaraFelise

This Trivia Game has a timer on each questions with multiple choices. The player has limited time to finish each questons. The question ends when the time runs out or when an answer is selected. After each questions, it will reveal the correct answer. Once all the questions are done, the page will reveal the number of questions that players answered correctly, incorrectly and unanswered. It play some sound clips after each questions or when displaying the correct answer. It also has some animation added.

The project is useful because it provides an example of languages/technologies I learned and show what I can do as a developer. It is using jQuery, Javascript timers, Bootstrap, HTML and, CSS.

For questions or concerns, please go to my website at carafelise.com or send an email at admin@carafelise.com. I maintain and developed this project.
